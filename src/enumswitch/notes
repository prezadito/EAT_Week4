'switch' statements are like if/else statements
The 'case' that matches the switch (parameter) will execute
If no break statement is found after case is matched and executed, it will continue executing all the following case execute statements
A 'default' case will execute (if written) when no case matches given parameter

Enums are a datatype that allow us to limit values when calling methods that require parameters
enum is short for enumerate, as in data enumeration (listing the choices you have)
Enum keywords (choices) are declared in ALL CAPS, separated by commas, with no semicolon needed at the end of statement
To use an enum list as possible parameters, declare the enums datatype variable by its name, then use the enum name in the argument/parameters
No need to declare the enum variable, since they are declared in the enum file; they just need to be declared in the class in which to be used
enums are immutable; they have no reference and thus cannot be changed
When enums are used, no default case is necessary because you cannot go outside of the enum keyword list, but still a good practice to use anyway
When you create a class object that has an enum datatype variable declared in it, you can use it by 'class_name.enum_name.keyword'
