Algorithms are essentially machine logic

Sorting algorithms orders lists/arrays/dbs

Selection sort:
Starts at index 0, moves rightward and finds the next smallest value, and swaps itself with that index.
The selection process resumes from the index after the swap, and repeats the process until the whole array is sorted from smallest to highest.
Once a number is swapped no need to compare it to the element on its left-side because its assumed to be in its rightful place in the order.

Insertion sort:
Starts at index 1, compares the value of that index with that on its left (array[-1]).
If the one on the left is bigger, it swaps index with the higher value via a temporary variable.
The smaller value index is compared with its left-side element to see if its lower than that, and swap places if it is.
Once that element finds its place in the order, we compare the element where we initially left off +1 and compare it with its left-side element.
Repeat the process until whole list is ordered.
