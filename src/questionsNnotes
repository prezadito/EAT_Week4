Is Map/HashMap a linear data structure?

A method's scope and for loop's scope is different.
A for loop that runs will affect both global and local variables used inside it.

Unless a method is called, it won't affect any global variables, even if they are changed inside the method implementation.
Only create global variables for variables that are used by multiple methods; otherwise keep declare/initialize them locally for readability and memory optimization.
